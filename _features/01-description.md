*Associate Profesor*  
*School of Software Engineering*  
*Pingdingshan University*

### Course goal
This course is an introductory undergraduate course in machine learning. The class will briefly cover topics in linear regression, linear classification, fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent Neural Networks, deep learning.

Prerequisites: You should understand basic probability and statistics, and college-level algebra and calculus. For the programming assignments, you should have some background in programming, and it would be helpful if you know Python and Pytorch.

/*The main goal of Machine Learning (ML) is the development of systems that are able to autonomously change their behavior based on experience. ML offers some of the more effective techniques for knowledge discovery in large data sets. ML has played a fundamental role in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, computer graphics and robotics.*/

/*The main goal of this course is to study the computational, mathematical and statistical foundations of ML, which are essential for the theoretical analysis of existing learning algorithms, the development of new algorithms and the well-founded application of ML to solve real-world problems.*/
